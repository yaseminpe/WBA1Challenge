        <p>I am Portuguese but relocated to Iceland about five years ago. I fell in love with diving here in Iceland. For the last three years, however, I have been going between Iceland and Thailand for a perfect mix of diving locations. In
            addition to all water sports, I love traveling, reading, yoga, animals, and music.</p>
